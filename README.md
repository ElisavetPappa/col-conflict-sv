### Publication status
In preparation

### Archive contents
This archive contains the [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) code for the analysis reported in the above study. The code is presented as a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) which are documents that combine both code and the output in a form that can be viewed online, but also re-run and the results reproduced when accompanied by the original dataset.

This repository contains a dataset with the extracted meta-analytic data and a Jupyter notebook that reports the analysis and results

1.  [Pappa_et_al_EntireConflict.ipynb](https://github.com/ElisavetPappa/col-conflic-sv/blob/main/Pappa_et_al_EntireConflict.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook with reproducible analysis for 1964-2024
2.  [Pappa_et_al_2014-2024.ipynb](https://github.com/ElisavetPappa/col-conflic-sv/blob/main/Pappa_et_al_2014-2024.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook with reproducible analysis for 2014-2024
3.  [CNMH_Data.zip]() - data file tbc

### Platform and package versions

To aid reproducibility, the platform (hardware, operating system), R language version, and package versions used to generate the results are automatically generated at runtime and reported at the end of the Jupyter notebook.
